Simple demo theme for PalMA
===========================

This is a minimalistic theme which can be copied and extended
for your own theme.

It includes these files:

* `background.png`.
  This is the background image which users will see on the team display
  when they work with PalMA. Any user windows will be shown on top of
  this background image.

* `screensaver.php`.
  PalMA shows this URL when no users are connected. Here we have a HTML page
  with dynamically updated information like the URL and the PIN.

These optional files are missing in the simple demo theme:

* `favicon.ico`.
  This icon is typically shown in bookmark lists of browsers or when the
  PalMA URL is saved on a smartphone.

* `palma-logo-49x18.png`.
  This logo is used by PalMA's web interface `index.php`.

* `palma-logo-67x25.png`.
  This logo is used by the login web interface `login.php`.

* `winvnc-palma.exe`.
  This is a preconfigured UltraVNC server for Windows.
